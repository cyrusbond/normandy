    Interacts with a RemoteSettings service.

    Recipes get published as records in one or both of the dedicated
    collections on Remote Settings. When disabled, those records are removed.

    Since Normandy already has the required approval/signoff features, the integration
    bypasses the one of Remote Settings (leveraging a specific server configuration for this
    particular collection).

    There are two collections used. One is the "baseline" collection, which
    is used only for recipes that fit within the baseline capabilities, and
    are therefore compatible with a broad range of clients. The second is the
    "capabilities" collection, in which all recipes are published. Clients
    that read from the capabilities collection are expected to process
    capabilities and only execute compatible recipes.

    .. notes::

        Remote Settings signoff workflow relies on several buckets (see kinto-signer API).

        The ``main-workspace`` is only readable and writable by authorized accounts.
        The ``main`` bucket is read-only, but publicly readable. The Remote Settings
        clients pull data from there.

        Since the review step is disabled for Normandy, publishing data is done in two steps:

        1. Create, update or delete records in the ``main-workspace`` bucket
        2. Approve the changes by flipping the ``status`` field to ``to-sign``
           in the collection metadata
        3. The server will sign and publish the new data to the ``main`` bucket.
